<h2>Robots.</h2> 
<p>Our understanding of robotics is bound to expand more and more in our near future and robot may very well become a greater part of our daily lives. Already today, there are so many robots that we use every single day. In general, robots will come with benefits as well as detriments. When used as bionic arms and other body parts, they become a great invention that could really help a mass of people that would have otherwise had many more hardships in life, especially with domestic tasks that the common person could do without much thought. In the case of a self-driving car, the number of accidents and deaths related to automobile collisions would drastically decrease because accidents would be caused by operation errors rather than human errors, such as being tired, drunk, or simply having slower reflexes and longer processing time than a machine. At the same time, there are people that actually enjoy driving, or the hundreds of thousands with jobs are drivers that are in risk of losing their job to robots. In cases like this, I think it is important to make sure that options are open. People should not be forced to rely on self-driving cars, but perhaps the option to use this as a feature can be open. Most importantly, however, the people creating these bots and deciding what becomes a norm in society should be diverse with different backgrounds, different problems, and different ideas to make sure that all people can be included.
